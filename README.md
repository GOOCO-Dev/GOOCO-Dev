#SDG 13: Climate Action
#  Selected Challenge: Deforestation and its impact on Ugandaâ€™s environment and climate resilience.

a. Clear Explaination of the Problem
  Deforestation in Uganda is a significant issue contributing to environmental degradation, loss 
  of biodiversity, and climate change. The challenge lies in efficiently detecting and monitoring 
  deforestation across large areas over time, which requires systematic, accurate, and scalable 
  solutions.
  Manual monitoring is resource-intensive, costly, and slow. Therefore, a more efficient method 
  of detecting deforestation is required. Satellite imagery offers the ability to cover large areas, 
  but it requires advanced techniques to process and analyze images for detecting changes in 
  forest cover over time, particularly deforestation events.
  
b. Algorithmic Technique and Why It can be Chosen
  To address the problem efficiently, we opt for the Change Detection Algorithm using 
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) along with Image Differencing. This technique is 
  not only computationally efficient but also effective in analyzing temporal changes in images 
  while reducing the dimensionality of data.
    Why PCA and Image Differencing:
    â–ª Image Differencing detects changes between two images taken at different 
    times by subtracting pixel values, highlighting the differences that indicate 
    deforestation.
    â–ª PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the images, improving the speed 
    and effectiveness of the change detection process. By focusing on the most 
    important components, PCA helps identify significant changes and patterns in 
    the satellite images that might not be obvious otherwise.
    â–ª This combination ensures that the algorithm is computationally feasible for 
    large datasets, such as satellite images covering extensive regions over 
    multiple years.
    
c. How the Solution Maps onto the Algorithm
  1. Input:
    â–ª Two satellite images: One representing the baseline (before deforestation) and 
    the other representing the post-deforestation period.
    â–ª Both images are taken from the same target forest over different time periods 
    (e.g., 2020 vs. 2023).

  3. Preprocessing:
    â–ª Image Registration: Align the images to ensure they are spatially matched.
    â–ª Normalization: Normalize the pixel values to a standard range (e.g., 0-1) for 
    easier comparison.

  4. Change Detection:
  â–ª Step 1: Image Differencing: The pixel-wise subtraction of the two images 
  identifies areas where changes have occurred. Significant changes indicate 
  potential deforestation areas.

  â–ª Step 2: PCA: The algorithm applies PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the 
  images, retaining the most significant components that capture the most 
  variation between the images. This step helps in isolating the deforested areas 
  more accurately.
  
  â–ª Step 3: Thresholding: A predefined threshold value is applied to the 
  difference image to classify areas with significant change (indicating 
  deforestation).
  
  â–ª Step 4: Segmentation and Refinement: Use post-processing steps, such as 
  morphological operations (e.g., dilation and erosion), to refine the detected 
  boundaries of deforested areas.
  
5. Output:
  â–ª The output will be a map highlighting areas of deforestation, showing the 
  extent of forest loss. This can be visualized on a map of Uganda and 
  quantified to produce actionable reports for policymakers.

d. Solving the Problem Algorithmically
To implement the solution algorithmically, we will follow these steps:
  1. Obtain Satellite Imagery:
    â–ª The algorithm is fed with two satellite images of the region of interest in 
    Uganda, one from the start period (before deforestation) and one from the later 
    period (after deforestation).

  3. Image Preprocessing:
    â–ª Image Alignment: If the images are from different sources or times, a 
    registration algorithm to align them spatially can be used.
    â–ª Normalization: The algorithm normalizes the pixel values to make sure they 
    are on the same scale for comparison.

  5. Image Differencing:
    â–ª Then subtracts the pixel values of the two images to highlight the differences 
    (areas where deforestation might have occurred).

  7. Apply PCA:
    â–ª Performs a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the difference image to 
    reduce the dimensionality. The idea is to focus on the principal components 
    that explain the most variance in the data, highlighting significant changes that 
    are more likely to correspond to deforestation.

  9. Thresholding:
    â–ª It then applies a threshold to the PCA results to classify areas where the 
    change is significant (representing deforestation).

  11. Post-processing:
    â–ª Morphological Operations: Applies dilation and erosion to refine the 
    boundaries of detected deforested areas. This step helps eliminate small 
    artifacts or noise and provides cleaner results.

  13. Output and Visualization:
    â–ª The algorithm generates a binary map marking areas of deforestation, which 
    can be overlaid on a GIS platform for further analysis.

e. Pseudocode
  function DetectDeforestation(image_before, image_after, threshold_value):
     // Step 1: Preprocess the images (convert to grayscale, normalize)
     image_before = Normalize(ConvertToGrayscale(image_before))
     image_after = Normalize(ConvertToGrayscale(image_after))
     // Step 2: Perform image differencing to highlight changes
     difference_image = SubtractImages(image_after, image_before)
     // Step 3: Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality and focus on significant changes
     pca_image = ApplyPCA(difference_image)
     // Step 4: Apply thresholding to isolate significant changes (deforestation)
     deforestation_map = ApplyThreshold(pca_image, threshold_value)
     // Step 5: Post-processing: Morphological operations to clean the result
     deforestation_map = MorphologicalOperations(deforestation_map)
     return deforestation_map
     function ApplyPCA(image):
     // Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality
     // Return the PCA components that capture significant changes
     return PCA(image)
     function SubtractImages(image1, image2):
     // Pixel-wise subtraction of the two images
     return image1 - image2
     function ApplyThreshold(image, threshold):
     // Apply threshold to classify deforested regions
     return image > threshold
     function MorphologicalOperations(image):
     // Apply erosion and dilation to refine the boundaries of the detected areas
     return Erosion(Dilation(image))
     
f. Runtime Complexity of the Algorithm
  â€¢ Preprocessing (Normalization and Grayscale Conversion): The time complexity 
  for preprocessing is O(v), where v is the number of pixels in the images.
  
  â€¢ Image Differencing: Subtracting the two images pixel-wise has a time complexity of 
  O(v).
  
  â€¢ PCA: Applying PCA has a time complexity of O(vâ‹…d), where ddd is the number of 
  principal components chosen (which is typically small compared to the total number 
  of pixels).
  
  â€¢ Thresholding: The thresholding step has a complexity of O(v).
  
  â€¢ Morphological Operations: Morphological operations, such as dilation and erosion, 
  have a complexity of O(v).
  
Overall Complexity: The total time complexity is O(vâ‹…d), where v is the number of pixels, 
and d is the number of principal components. This makes the algorithm efficient and scalable 
for large satellite images
